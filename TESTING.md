This file was created on the second edition of this project. All issues in the assessment feedback form were carried out first, followed by any additional information that would be of benefit to the README & TESTING sections.

Visit the deployed site [Hobby](https://katemcguane.github.io/hobby/index.html) for reference.

## Compatability

The website was tested on three different browsers: Brave, Chrome, & Microsoft Edge. It was compatable across all three.

The following elements were tested manually on each of the browsers:
  - Internal links work correctly, & as expected.
  - External links to socials work on the browsers listed & open a new tab for each corresponding link.
  - The contact form works correctly & displays the necessary response page on execution.

## Responsiveness

The website was tested manually throughout the project development using DevTools to check for responsiveness.

The responsiveness was confirmed with [Responsive Website Design Tester](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/). The following are samples of some of the responsiveness implemented.
